   This file is the ONLY place that touches persistent state.

   in production, the bodies of these functions can be swapped
   for real backend calls (Firebase / REST API) without the
   rest of the app changing.

   State machine (the five pillars):
     PENDING  ->  APPROVED  ->  SYNCING_WITH_RFX_OS  ->  RFX_OS_CONFIRMED  ->  ACTIVE
                       \->  REJECTED
     APPROVED ->  SYNC_FAILED  ->  (automatic retry)  ->  SYNCING_WITH_RFX_OS ...

     REFUND INTELLIGENCE — the layer that remembers who refunded
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     A refund is a signal, not a transaction. Every request is scored
     against the identity's full history before staff ever see it:
       • fingerprint = email + normalized name + phone + payment method
       • prior refunds by this identity
       • velocity (N refunds within a window)
       • early refund (requested right after purchase)
       • pre-registration refund (never even registered)
       • payment-link reuse across refunded enrollments
     Scores are flags for the moderator — never auto-verdicts (the same
     philosophy as the integrity monitor). An executed refund REVOKES
     material rights and starts a cooldown: the identity can't re-enroll
     until the window passes.

This is how we stop a course from being shared with someone else. Suspicious activity, unusual quiz timing or perfect-score patterns are reviewed by the moderator, who checks the evidence before any decision. A refund request ends your access to materials and starts a re-application cooldown; the full policy is in the agreements you accepted.'

They are not for show. When something looks unusual, a moderator reviews the evidence before any decision is made — you are never judged by a machine alone. If a measure ever feels like extra fuss, it is the thing standing between you and a day when your account stops working for no reason you can see. Reality FX runs deliberately small and intimate — enrolment is capped and quality comes before quantity — so every student gets this level of care, and every student is protected by it.'

The journey that brought you here runs through a monitored pipeline with over a dozen checkpoints, and every one of them is verified before you are handed your identity. A full system audit runs 19 checks — from the payment webhook that created your enrollment, to the handshake that introduced you to the Academy, to the guarantee that every student code is unique and every rand reconciles across the ledgers. Three security self-tests attack the system the way an intruder would — brute-forcing your login, guessing verification codes, reusing an expired registration link — and each attack is defended; a fourth verifies that your identity data is deleted the moment a decision is made. More than thirty kinds of security events are recorded for the team to review, and a capacity check keeps the system comfortably ahead of every student it serves. This is not complexity for its own sake; it is the machinery that makes your account work without drama, year after year. A lot of people built this carefully, and they keep auditing it so you never have to think about it.'

The entire two-thousand-student academy weighs about 34 MB of records — roughly 17 KB per student — and that is the browser demo\'s limit, not the Academy\'s: production storage is effectively unlimited, so doubling overnight would not blink. And this is deliberate: Reality FX was engineered to run on its own. The pipeline automates the journey from payment to classroom, staff guide and moderate, the machine carries the load — it does not depend on any single person, and it was built to keep teaching long after its founders. Every year on Founder\'s Day — 1 November — the Academy honours the founder who built the self-reliant school you now study in; the name stays quiet, because the learning is the point. On that day the Academy plays the founder\'s own words — the name stays quiet, but the voice does not. You are not a customer; you are family, and the Academy you are joining was built to stand.'

Immediately after, a second email carries a secure, single-use registration link that leads into the gate.' },
      { t: 'The gate — nobody walks in unregistered', b: 'Buying a course is not the same as becoming a student. Through the secure link the student provides their details, verifies their email with a 6-digit code, passes CAPTCHA, submits identity information including a selfie, and accepts the exact version of the Terms, Conditions and Fair Usage Policy (with the time of acceptance recorded). The system verifies the registration is tied to a genuine paid enrolment and that the link is valid and unused.' },
      { t: 'Approval & identity', b: 'Once approved, the student receives their official Reality FX identity: a unique Student ID and Student Code. The record is then handed to RFX OS over the bridge — an idempotent handshake, so a network hiccup can never create two identities for one student. Until this completes, the student holds a demo / under-review profile with no full access.' },
      { t: 'The Student Portal — everything student', b: 'The portal is the main office of campus reception. Students find their identity and vital details (masked until revealed), their RFX wallet and credit, invoices and an official Mailbox, live support, their referral link, merch, and the ability to enrol in further courses without re-registering — because they are already verified.' },
      { t: 'RFX OS Academy — the classroom', b: 'The Academy is the most protected room: every resource asks “is this authenticated Student ID authorised?” before delivering anything. Pages are watermarked, copying is blocked, printing is blacked out by default and capture attempts are logged. One student, one account, one active session — signing in on a new device ends the old session automatically.' },
      { t: 'The machine behind it', b: 'The system runs a full audit of 20 checks and attacks itself with 5 security self-tests the way an intruder would — brute-forcing logins, guessing verification codes, reusing expired links — and defends against each. More than 35 kinds of security events are recorded for review. The whole Academy has been simulated at 2,000 students at once and every check still passed.' },
      { t: 'The staff role — the human line', b: 'Staff never need to be software developers. They approve registrations, resolve flagged cases, run the one-click audit and repair, refresh logs, and talk to the system motherboard on the rare technical occasion. They work shifts to keep the 24/7 reception promise, and they are the warm hand that makes the machine feel human to every student.' },
      { t: 'Built to outlive any one of us', b: 'The entire journey is automated end to end, engineered to run without depending on any single person. A school that depends on one person will die with them — this Academy was built to outlive its founders, and to keep teaching long after. The learning is the point.' },
